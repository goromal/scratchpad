# Scratchpad

A place for me to do math. Powered by [sage](https://doc.sagemath.org/) as well as my own [packages](https://goromal.github.io/anixpkgs/).

For the casual observer, notebooks can be viewed from the browser using GitHub's own notebook rendering functionality. [Example: Using Lagrange's equations to model and simulate a 3D pendulum](https://github.com/goromal/scratchpad/blob/1df436e422a45d3185fb05a18bee7a07c122825d/dynamics/modeling/holonomic_lagrange_pendulum_sim.ipynb)

## Get Started

1. Install Nix and Direnv.
2. Run `spsage` (for Python or Mathematica-esque work) or `spoctave` (for Matlab-esque work) in this directory.
