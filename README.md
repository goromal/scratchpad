# Scratchpad

A place for me to do math. Powered by [sage](https://doc.sagemath.org/) as well as my own [packages](https://goromal.github.io/anixpkgs/).

## Get Started

1. Install Nix and Direnv.
2. Run `spsage` (for Python or Mathematica-esque work) or `spoctave` (for Matlab-esque work) in this directory.
