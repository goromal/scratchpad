    "# 2D Range-Bearing Landmark Resolution with Ceres\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-level problem description:** A moving vehicle confined to the 2D plane is equipped with a range-bearing device that is giving noisy 2D range and bearing measurements pointing to a static landmark at regular intervals. The bearing error in the measurement can be thought of as a product of noise as well as a steady bias, whereas the range measurement is just noisy. The goal is to incrementally collapse uncertainty about where the static landmark is by moving the vehicle around and continually collecting noisy and biased measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will lay out some approximating equations to solve this problem and provide a corresponding Python script to solve a version of the problem.\n",

    "## Problem Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The three reference frames in the problem definition (see Fig. 1) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The static world frame $W$\n",
    "  * The moving vehicle frame $B$\n",
    "  * The sensor frame $S$, defined for convenience as having the x-axis aligned with the detected bearing measurement (*not* the actual static mounting orientation of the sensor w.r.t. the vehicle frame).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://andrewtorgesen.com/res/img/rangebearing_dists.svg\" width=\"400\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*Figure 1: Reference frames and uncertainty models for the range-bearing landmark localization problem. When expressed in the sensor ($S$) frame, the measurement covariance can be approximated as a diagonal matrix $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^S$, though the true uncertainty distribution $\\mathbf{\\mathcal{U}}^S$ is a Gaussian over the $SE(2)$ manifold.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The uncertainty resulting from sensor noise is most appropriately derived in the $S$ frame (approximated by an ellipse) and subsequently re-expressed in the $W$ frame via a linear approximation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^S\\approx\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_d^2 & 0\\\\0 & \\left(d\\sigma_{\\theta}\\right)^2\\end{bmatrix}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^W\\approx\\mathbf{R}_S^W\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^S\\left(\\mathbf{R}_S^W\\right)^\\top.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This measurement covariance is associated with a world-frame range-bearing measurement, expressable as a 2D vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{b}^W\\triangleq\\mathbf{R}_S^W\\begin{bmatrix}d\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the measurement of the static landmark location can be calculated at each time stamp as a function of the vehicle position in the world frame $\\mathbf{p}^W_{B/W}$ and the range-bearing measurement $\\mathbf{b}^W$ (which is altered by the unknown heading bias $\\tilde{\\mathbf{R}}$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{l}^W=\\mathbf{p}^W_{B/W}+\\tilde{\\mathbf{R}}\\mathbf{b}^W.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As illustrated in Fig. 2, though the vehicle may be moving across successive time stamps and collecting new range-bearing measurements, the *true* landmark location is known to be static, and that information/assumption can be exploited in the task of estimating its location along with the sensor heading bias term.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://andrewtorgesen.com/res/img/rangebearing_iters.svg\" width=\"400\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*Figure 2: Successive range-bearing measurements of a static landmark from a moving vehicle frame.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization will thus be defined as minimizing all error terms (or *residuals*) $\\mathbf{r}_k$ across all time stamps which capture the difference between the current bearing measurement and the *implicit* bearing measurement derived from the current belief about the static landmark location. The residual term at each time stamp is scaled by the inverse square root of the measurement covariance, in keeping with the standard least-squares formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{r}_k=\\left(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_k^W\\right)^{-1/2}\\left(\\mathbf{b}_k^W-\\tilde{\\mathbf{R}}^\\top\\left(\\mathbf{l}^W-\\mathbf{p}_{B/W,k}^W\\right)\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual implementation in C++ (called *RangeBearing2DFactor*) can be found [in the ceres-factors source code](https://github.com/goromal/ceres-factors/blob/8bff0917d7a05d25f86b23ff097bfebf10a987f9/include/ceres-factors/Factors.h#L109) (which the Python package used in this demo wraps). At each time step $k$, a factor is constructed and added to the graph from\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Range measurement $d_k$ with associated standard deviation $\\sigma_d$\n",
    "  * Heading measurement $\\mathbf{R}_{S,k}^B$ with associated standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ (assumed to be statically biased by an unknown mount calibration error $\\tilde{\\mathbf{R}}$)\n",
    "  * The estimated vehicle position $\\mathbf{p}_{B/W,k}^W$\n",
    "  * The estimated vehicle orientation $\\mathbf{R}_{B,k}^W$\n",
    "\n",
    "from which the residual equation is computed using the preceding equations in this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the basic problem formulated as a Ceres Solver optimization. In this scenario, the sensor heading bias is zero and 100 measurements are taken as the vehicle moves with both translational and angular velocity."
